        <p>Dogs are often referred to as "man's best friend", and for good reason. Dogs are known to be smart, loyal, protective, bonding, and highly trainable.
		There are many different dog breeds and each breed is unique, but most breeds have a combination of the previously mentioned qualities.</p>
		<p>I believe my favorite breed of dogs is the Lagotto Romagnolo. A few of the characteristics that make the Lagotto stand out are intelligence, loyalty, agility, and they
		don't shed.</p>
